# Auto-generated docker-compose.yml - DO NOT EDIT
# Generated by stack-select.sh
# 
# This file is a stub. The actual configuration is managed by:
# - ./stack-select.sh (to select the active stack)
# - ./docker-compose-wrapper.sh (to run docker-compose with the correct files)
# - ./start.sh and ./stop.sh (convenience scripts)
#
# The wrapper script automatically includes:
# - stacks/common/base/docker-compose.yml
# - stacks/<selected-stack>/docker-compose.yml
# - stacks/common/monitoring/docker-compose.yml  
# - stacks/common/nginx/docker-compose.yml
#
# To manage services, use:
# ./start.sh              # Start all services
# ./stop.sh               # Stop all services
# ./docker-compose-wrapper.sh ps   # Check status
# ./docker-compose-wrapper.sh logs  # View logs
