# MISTRAL_000011: Generate Comprehensive Setup Specification

## Objective
Create a detailed specification document that swissarmyhammer can use to automatically set up the complete multi-stack LLM environment, including both Ollama and Mistral.rs options.

## Context
The final step is to create a comprehensive specification that captures all the implementation details from the previous steps into a format that swissarmyhammer can execute for automated setup.

## Tasks

### 1. Create Master Specification
- Generate `specifications/multi-stack-llm-setup.md`
- Include all setup steps in order
- Add validation checkpoints
- Include rollback procedures

### 2. Define Prerequisites and Validation
- System requirements checking
- Software dependency verification
- Network configuration validation
- Storage space requirements

### 3. Document Automated Workflows
- Stack selection process
- Service deployment steps
- Model download automation
- Testing and verification

### 4. Include Configuration Templates
- Environment variable templates
- Service configuration examples
- Model selection guides
- Performance tuning options

## Implementation Details

The specification should include:

```markdown
# Multi-Stack LLM Infrastructure Setup Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the complete setup process for a multi-stack LLM infrastructure supporting both Ollama and Mistral.rs inference engines.

## Prerequisites
- Mac Studio with M2/M3 Ultra
- 64GB+ RAM (192GB for large models)
- 500GB+ available storage
- Docker Desktop installed
- SSH access configured

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Structure
1. Create multi-stack directory structure
2. Implement stack selection mechanism
3. Separate common components

### Phase 2: Monitoring Infrastructure
1. Extract common monitoring components
2. Configure Prometheus for multi-stack support
3. Create unified Grafana dashboards

### Phase 3: Mistral.rs Integration
1. Build Mistral.rs Docker image
2. Configure Docker Compose
3. Implement API compatibility layer
4. Set up model management

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Run integration tests
2. Verify monitoring
3. Test Aider compatibility
4. Benchmark performance

## Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Stack selection works
- [ ] Monitoring accessible
- [ ] Mistral.rs responds to API calls
- [ ] Models can be downloaded
- [ ] Aider connects successfully

## Rollback Procedures
In case of failure:
1. Restore original docker-compose.yml
2. Remove new directories
3. Clean up Docker images
4. Revert configuration changes
```

## Success Criteria
- Specification is complete and executable
- swissarmyhammer can run the setup unattended
- All components are properly configured
- System is ready for production use

## Estimated Changes
- ~1000 lines of specification documentation
- Includes all configuration templates
- Complete setup automation
